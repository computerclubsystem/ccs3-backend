# TODO: Find out how can we install dependencies in node_modules and not use them as links so we can just copy node_modules
# Because node_modules does not have the real code but just links to libs/.../dist
# we need to copy app dependency folders (libs) with their package.json and dist folders
# This will ensure import in apps will find the correct path (not in node_modules/@computerclubmanager but in libs/.../dist)
